An employee directory built with react that generates a table of random users from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/). 
You can then manipulate the table in the following ways:

  * Sort the table by category

  * Filter the users by at any of their listed information


You can view the deployed app on [Github Pages](https://motoroboto.github.io/employeedirectory/).
